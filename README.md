## How to use

Every exercise is in his folder (1 for part1). You can directly use the ipynb file to run each exercise separatly. Or you can also execute the code directly in an environment

```bash
# create a virtual env
python -m venv .env

# activate the env
source .env

# install the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# then go inside each directory to run the exercise
python file.py
```
